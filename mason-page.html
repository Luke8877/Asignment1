                The Blueberry, any of several North American shrubs of the genus Vaccinium (family Ericaceae), prized for their sweet edible fruits.
                Hailed as a superfood, blueberries are an excellent source of dietary fibre, vitamin C, vitamin K, manganese, iron, and a number of antioxidants.

              	<h2>Cultivation</h2>
              	<ul>
                	<li>Blueberries prefer full sun, although the plants will tolerate partial shade.</li>
                	<li>As shade increases, the bushes produce fewer blossoms, and fruit production declines.</li>
                	<li>Blueberries require acidic, well-drained, loose soils with a high organic matter content.</li>
                	<li>Blueberry plants grow slowly and reach full size in 8 to 10 years</li>
                	<li>Plants won't have much fruit the first 2 to 3 years. Harvest is bigger after 5 years.</li>
                	<li>A single blueberry will take around 2 to 3 months to go from flowering to ripening.</li>
              	</ul>

				<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>The fiber, potassium, folate, vitamin C, vitamin B6, and phytonutrient content in blueberries supports heart health.</li>
				<li>The absence of cholesterol from blueberries is also beneficial to the heart.</li>
				<li>Fiber content helps to reduce the total amount of cholesterol in the blood and decrease the risk of heart disease.</li>
