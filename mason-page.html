               	<li>Blueberries prefer full sun, although the plants will tolerate partial shade.</li>
               	<li>As shade increases, the bushes produce fewer blossoms, and fruit production declines.</li>
               	<li>Blueberries require acidic, well-drained, loose soils with a high organic matter content.</li>
               	<li>Blueberry plants grow slowly and reach full size in 8 to 10 years</li>
               	<li>Plants won't have much fruit the first 2 to 3 years. Harvest is bigger after 5 years.</li>
               	<li>A single blueberry will take around 2 to 3 months to go from flowering to ripening.</li>

				</div>
				<div class="benefit-card">
					<h3>Improved Heart Health</h3>

				</div>
				<div class="benefit-card">
					<h3>Boost Brain Function</h3>
					<p>Studies suggest that blueberries can help improve cognitive function and delay age-related decline in brain health. They may enhance memory, concentration, and overall brain performance due to their high levels of flavonoids and other compounds that protect brain cells.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefit-card">
					<h3>Supports Healthy Digestion</h3>
					<p>Blueberries are a good source of dietary fiber, which promotes healthy digestion by helping to regulate bowel movements and prevent constipation. Fiber also supports a healthy gut microbiome, contributing to better overall digestive health.</p>
