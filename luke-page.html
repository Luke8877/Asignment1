                <h2>Cultivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Kiwis thrive in warm climates but can also grow in areas with cooler temperatures, provided they are protected from frost. 
                    The kiwi vine is a vigorous grower and requires ample space and support for optimal growth. 
                    It takes about 3-5 years for a kiwi plant to produce fruit after planting.

                <p>
                    Did you know that kiwifruit gets its name from the kiwi bird of New Zealand? Although the fruit originated in China, 
                    it was New Zealand growers who popularized the name. Kiwis are also known for their skin, which some people enjoy eating 
                    despite its fuzzy texture!
